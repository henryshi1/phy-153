Python scripts submitted for 4 Homework assignments and 1 Final project. Homework assignments in the **Homework** folder and final project in the **Final Project** folder.

# Homework 1

No code submitted for this assignment. Data given by `PHY153hw01data.csv` or `PHY153hw01data.xlsx` in folder `Homework/hw01`.

# Homework 2

Implemented Lecture 4 examples 1-6 in Python. `See Homework/hw02` for assignment description, Lecture 4 slides, and Python code files. Created the following files:

* `L4ex1.py` - Creating and Manipulating Lists, List Arithmetic, Accessing List Elements

* `L4ex2.py` - List and Loops, Accessing List Elements

* `L4ex3.py` - Lists and Loops, Code Tracing

* `L4ex4.py` - Lists and Loops, Appending to Lists

* `L4ex5.py` - Lists and Loops, Appending to Lists, Accessing List Elements

* `L4ex6.py` - Write a python code (a script) that does the following:

  * Create a list containing the given data:

    \[38.0, 34.5, 29.9, 28.6, 35.1, 37.3, 29.7, 32.5, 27.9, 36.5, 37.5, 40.9, 31.3, 24.7, 27.5, 39.9, 33.6, 31.3, 33.9, 40.0, 32.2, 30.5, 37.5, 25.6, 36.3, 35.7, 34.9, 41.4, 37.4, 29.5, 32.3, 34.1\]

  * Create a loop that goes over all values and calculates corresponding values in C degrees. 

$$C = \frac{5}{9} (F-32)$$

# Homework 3

* `L7ex1.py` - Math.py Module, Trigonometry, Exponents, Square Root, Math Constants

* `L7ex2.py` - Module Import, Trigonometry

* `L7ex3.py` - Write a code that calculates sin(x)+2cos(x) for x of 10 degrees and of 20 degrees, in a user defined function with argument x.

* `L7ex4.py` - $A=2$ is a constant. Write a code to calculate values of a function $f(x)$ for $x=10.56$ in 2 ways: with a user-defined function and without.

$$f(x) = A\sqrt{x}$$

* `L7ex5.py` - $A=2$ is a constant. Write a code to calculate values of a function $f(x)$ for $x=10.56$ in 2 ways: with a user-defined function and without. Add uncertainty calculation, assuming $\sigma_x / x = 0.10$.

$$f(x) = A\sqrt{x}$$

* `L7ex5.py` -
